'''
The purpose of this program is to show how honey encryption
works. Given any password, the program should be able to
give the user a selection of manipulated passwords (sweet
words). If the sweet word is entered, then the program will
trigger an alarm. Of course, the correct password will
not trigger the alarm.
Current issues:
-certain false passwords are not displaying false data when
 they should
-more modularized code is needed
-debugging at line 133 is needed
